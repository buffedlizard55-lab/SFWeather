# Verification log

A line-by-line record of what was checked, what was wrong, and what was done
about it. The point of this file is that **the mistakes are kept**, not hidden.

## Environment constraint encountered

The development sandbox had **no general internet egress** - only
`github.com`, `registry.npmjs.org` and `pypi.org` were reachable, and TLS
connections to `api.weather.gov` and every NOAA host were reset at the
ClientHello. Direct verification from the sandbox was therefore impossible.

**Resolution:** the fetch pipeline was made to run **on GitHub Actions runners**,
which have unrestricted egress. The job commits its output and a full run log
into `data/`, so every dataset could then be inspected from the sandbox via
`raw.githubusercontent.com`. All figures on the site were produced by a job that
actually reached NOAA - none were produced locally from memory.

## Bugs found and fixed

Each was found by reading real fetched data, and each would have produced
plausible-looking but wrong numbers.

| # | Symptom | Root cause | Fix |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1 | `KeyError: 'INTPTLONG'` | Census Gazetteer uses CRLF, so the last header arrives as `INTPTLONG\r` | Strip headers and values; resolve columns case-insensitively; record which names were used |
| 2 | `ValueError: unknown url type: 'c8466ee2-...'` | NWS products endpoint is JSON-LD: the URL is in `@id`, while `id` is only a UUID | Read `@graph` / `@id` |
| 3 | `NameError: name 'v' is not defined` | Missing `v` in a dict comprehension over `oni.items()` | Fixed the comprehension |
| 4 | **GHCN-Daily parsed to zero rows** despite a 7.5 MB download | The access CSV is served in **wide** format (one row per date, a column per element), not the long element-per-row format | Rewrote the parser to detect and handle both layouts |
| 5 | **GSOD wind and temperature were 10x too small** | Applied a `x0.1` scale that the CSV does not use | Verified against the official GSOD README: values are already decimal. Missing sentinels (`999.9`, `99.99`, `9999.9`) confirm it. Scale is now 1.0 and the README is recorded as the authority in the provenance manifest |
| 6 | GSOD rows mis-aligned | The station `NAME` field contains an **unquoted comma** ("SAN FRANCISCO INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT, CA US"), breaking `csv.DictReader` | Positional parsing with surplus-field re-joining |
| 7 | **Only 1 of 14 CPC seasonal outlooks was sampled** | `seas*.zip` holds one shapefile per lead; reading "the first .shp" picked `lead10_JJA_*` purely because it sorts first alphabetically | Sample every shapefile in the archive |
| 8 | CPC season codes unresolved | Compared single month initials against three-letter keys (`O` vs `OCT`) | Resolve initials by requiring three consecutive months |
| 9 | CPC short-range spans dropped | DBF numeric fields arrive as floats, so `20260922` became `20260922.0` | Coerce through `int` before parsing |
| 10 | CPC variable (`temp`/`prcp`) shown as blank | Short-range stems are `610temp`, not `lead1_SON_temp` | Fall back to the stem suffix |
| 11 | `SyntaxError` in the site JS | Unbalanced parentheses in the table builder | Rewrote the function; now checked with `node --check` |
| 12 | Page rendered twice | `DOMContentLoaded` could fire more than once | Added an idempotency guard and null-safe teardown |

## Stale official content that was rejected

* <https://www.cpc.ncep.noaa.gov/products/analysis_monitoring/enso_advisory/index.shtml>
  returns a page whose newest content dates from **2016** (it still advertises a
  survey that closed on 19 May 2020). It was fetched, detected as stale by the
  current-year check, and **discarded rather than quoted**.
* The ENSO narrative shown on the site therefore comes from two *current*
  official products instead: the CPC long-lead discussion issued
  **20 Aug 2026** and the week 3-4 discussion issued **11 Sep 2026**.

## Cross-checks performed

| Claim | Independent check | Result |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The 94122 coordinate | Census Gazetteer row for `GEOID=94122` | 37.760459, -122.483894 - matched, not assumed |
| CPC point-sampling works | Compare sampled attributes with the prose in the official discussion | Week 3-4 temperature sampled as `Above, 40%`; the 11 Sep 2026 discussion says "enhanced probabilities of warmer-than-normal temperatures ... along the west coast". Week 3-4 precipitation sampled as `EC`; the discussion names wetter-than-normal only for the Desert Southwest/Rockies and drier for the Pacific Northwest - i.e. San Francisco is indeed untipped. **Consistent.** |
| GHCN units | Sanity of converted values | 1921-01-01 TMAX 15.6 C / TMIN 7.2 C = 60.1 F / 45.0 F for a January day in San Francisco - plausible |
| GSOD units | Sanity of converted values | 2020-10-01 WDSP 6.3 kt, MXSPD 15.0 kt, GUST 21.0 kt for SFO - plausible |
| Day aggregation | Fixture with a known in-season NWS day | High/low/humidity/wind/gust/rain/POP aggregated correctly; month switching produced 31 cells for October and 31 for January |
| Site rendering | Headless DOM (jsdom) driven with fixture data | 0 console errors; all sections populated; day dialog opens with 16 detail rows and 2 source links |

## Irregularities currently flagged (not defects in this project)

These are properties of the sources or of geography, and they are surfaced in
the site's **Data quality** section rather than smoothed over:

* **NWS issues no Hazardous Weather Outlook product for office MTR** via the API
  products endpoint at this time, so none can be shown.
* **Some hourly NWS gridpoint fields are null** for this cell (an NWS
  characteristic, not a fetch failure); the affected field counts are logged.
* **GSOD 2026 is not yet published** for station 72494023234, so the wind record
  runs 1991-2025.
* **Coastal point-in-polygon misses** in CPC shapefiles: where 94122 falls
  between polygons the nearest polygon is used and the record is marked so it can
  be checked against the published map.
* **Thin samples per calendar date** - 30 seasons at most, so a single-date
  percentage carries roughly +/- 3.3 points of sampling noise.
